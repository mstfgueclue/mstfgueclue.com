This is my personal website, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). It serves as a digital space where I share my experiences, findings and thoughts around software engineering, architecture and tech-related topics.

## Features

- Built with **Next.js 14**
- Written in **TypeScript**
- Blog powered by **MDX** (`@mdx-js/react`, `@next/mdx`)
- Styled using **Tailwind CSS**
- Enhanced typography via **@tailwindcss/typography**
- Icons provided by **Lucide React**

## Getting Started 
First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```
Your site should now be running at http://localhost:3000.
